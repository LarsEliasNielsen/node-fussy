It filters unwanted noise out of your news streams,\r\nbut not too much: fussy will watch carefully and try to suggest things from time to time.\r\nIf you change your mind later, fussy will detect it, and adjust your profile a.k.a \"filter bubble\",\r\nso that it is not a bubble anymore.\r\n\r\nIt's sounds like magic, but you can trust fussy. Because you know, he is very picky.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nEverytime you call profile#learn() this will increment or decrement some weights in the underlying network of tags.\r\nThat's why Fussy can fix profiles back: you can decrement the importance of keywords dynamically,\r\nhours, days or months after liking them.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    $ npm install fussy\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n```CoffeeScript\r\n{Database, Profile} = require 'fussy'\r\ndatabase = new Database()\r\ndatabase.learn\r\n  \"Twitter to sue Google over twitter stream monetization\": [\"Technology\", \"Twitter\", \"Google\", \"Internet\"]\r\n  \"A new library open in the east center in NYC\": [\"city\",\"library\",\"nyc\"]\r\n  \"Rumors: Apple to launch a new tablet for emerging markets\": [\"Technology\", \"Apple\", \"Rumor\"]\r\n  \"Microsoft reveal its new data center\": [\"Technology\", \"Rumor\", \"Microsoft\"]\r\n  \"An energy-friendly data center for emerging countries\": [\"Technology\", \"World\", \"Energy\"]\r\n  \"History of the countries: world music festival at the museum\": [\"Music\", \"City\",\"Culture\"]\r\n  \"Visiting a museum is good for health\": [\"Health\", \"Culture\"]\r\n  \"Using home brew to install appplications on your Apple macbook\": [\"Computers\", \"Software\", \"Apple\"]\r\n  \"How to brew your own beer\": [\"DIY\", \"Fooding\", \"Beverages\", \"Beer\"]\r\n  \"Facebook to reveal a new open source library\": [\"Opensource\",\"Technology\",\"Facebook\",\"Social Networks\"]\r\n\r\nprofile = new Profile()\r\n\r\n# news to ask the user for like/dislike\r\ntraining = database.tag [\r\n  \"Visit the NYC museum using your tablet\"\r\n  \"How to brew your own coffee\"\r\n  \"Google to launch a new museum app\"\r\n  \"Apple to sue Microsoft\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nfor txt, keywords of training\r\n\r\n  # +1: like, 0: indifference, -1: dislike \r\n  choice = 1\r\n\r\n  profile.learn txt, keywords, choice\r\n\r\n# news to sort / rate\r\nnews = database.tag [\r\n  \"Open source conference give free beer to first 50 people in NY\"\r\n  \"What is in people's head? an in-depth data analysis\"\r\n]\r\nrecommendations = profile.recommend news\r\nconsole.log \"--> #{Object.keys recommendations}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n### Automatic text tagging\r\n\r\nFussy has a built-in text tagger. \r\n\r\n#### Learning tags\r\n\r\nFussy need to learn tags from an existing dataset: \r\n\r\n```CoffeeScript\r\nfussy = require 'fussy'\r\ndatabase = new fussy.Database()\r\ndatabase.learn\r\n  \"a short test text\": [\"keyword one\", \"keyword two\"]\r\n  \"a second text\": [\"keyword one\", \"a new keyword\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Tagging words\r\n\r\nThen you can use it to tag text:\r\n\r\n```CoffeeScript\r\ntagged = database.tag [\r\n  \" a second test\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### User recommendation\r\n\r\nTo be continued, see the example\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n#### 0.0.0\r\n\r\n * Initial version, not very documented\r\n","tagline":"A recommendation engine that care about user actions"}
